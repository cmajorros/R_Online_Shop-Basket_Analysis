# R_Online_Shop_Market-Basket_Analysis
In this project, I demonstrate how to perform Market Basket Analysis in R. I used the dataset from Kaggle. It is the online retail store. 
I also include the dataset here too (in case you do not want to download from kaggle). These are the tasks I have done for this project;

1) Import the data set
2) Convert the data to transaction format.
3) Remove duplicate transaction.
4) Calculate the association of transaction.
